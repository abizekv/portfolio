                Hi, I’m Abhishek — an aspiring full-stack developer from Kerala with a background in mathematics and a strong passion for technology. Over the past few months, I’ve been actively building projects that have helped me grow as a developer and gain hands-on experience with both frontend and backend tools.
<br /> <br />
                I’m currently looking for opportunities to work on real-world projects, collaborate with other developers, and continue learning every day. I’m excited to contribute, grow, and be part of a team where I can turn ideas into impactful solutions.
